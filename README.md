# Odin landing page

A simple landing page, created as part of **The Odin Project (TOP)** exercises. This project is focused on **HTML** and **CSS** and basic layout design using **Flexbox**.

## About the Project
- The theme I chose is a fictional **racing academy**.
- The page is divided into four main sections:
  - Header section
  - Hero section with text and image
  - Information section with images and descriptions
  - Quote/testimonial section
- It also includes a call-to-action section and a footer.
